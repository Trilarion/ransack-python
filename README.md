Ransack - a Python based roguelike

In very early stages at the moment. Our hero can explore the levels, collect items, and fight monsters. There is only one type of monster right now.

Move with arrow keys. Battles occur Final Fantasy style. Battle screen is currently blank. Press 'f' to fight.

A basic level editor is included. Use 't' to select tiles, space to place tiles, and 'd' to toggle draw mode. 's' saves a map and 'l' loads.

Currently using Nintendo Link sprites for player until I get around to designing my own.

The level editor uses EzText courtest of pywiz32 - http://www.pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html
